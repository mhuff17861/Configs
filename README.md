# Configs
Just a place for me to put config files. Automation is busted, but it's better than it was.

# Current Configurations
* i3
* zsh
  * .zshrc
  * jonathanxmicah theme (minor mod to jonathan theme)

# Notes to Self for future automation
* coc.nvim requires node to be installed. Also, extra configuration for language servers via CocInstall
  * Also npm and yarn
  * lang servers CocInstall coc-tsserver coc-json coc-html coc-css coc-pyright
